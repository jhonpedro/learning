### Challenges

All the challanges that i made are in here.
The name of each file in ``` Challenges/ ``` is very descritive, so, if you want to see any resolution you can find by it's name. These "chalenges" come from those algorithm tests that you can find in any place, like [Codility](https://www.codility.com/) or [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/) and so on...


### Data Structures

I am implementing some data structures in Javascript and Python to see how each language manage the environment around that especific data structre. But mainly its for understand and develop the data structures itself. I've already studied this in Data Struture classes which was presented to me in the second period of college but I really liked this class and now I'm here.



ps: I used nodemon here to just dont need to type ``` node ... ``` every time i want to see de result. Aparently (I didnt test it) nodemon works for Python too
